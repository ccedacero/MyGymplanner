1. **Equity Negotiation**
   - Always negotiate equity, not just base
   - At startups: Ask for +20-30% more equity
   - At public companies: RSUs are as good as cash
   - Understand: 4-year vest, 1-year cliff, refresh grants

2. **Strategic Company Selection**

### Strategy 9: Entrepreneurship/Consulting

**Build Leverage Beyond Employment**

1. **Independent Consulting (Months 18-24)**
   - Once you have strong brand/network
   - Rate: $150-$350/hour ($300K-$700K/year if full-time)
   - NYC market: Huge demand for technical consultants
   - Balance: Keep full-time job, consult 10-15 hours/week

   - Low time commitment once network established

### Strategy 10: Geographic Arbitrage

**NYC-Specific Opportunities**

1. **Remote Work for SF Companies**
   - Many SF companies pay SF salaries for NYC
   - SF Senior SWE: $200K-$280K base (vs NYC $160K-$230K)
   - Target: Stripe, Airbnb, Uber, Coinbase (all have remote)
   - Advantage: SF salary + NYC cost of living (lower than SF)

   - Live in cheaper NYC suburbs (Jersey City, Hoboken, Queens)
   - Rent: Save $1,000-$2,000/month
   - Or: Live upstate/NJ, come to office 2-3 days/week
   - Savings: $12K-$24K/year

3. **International Remote**
   - Some roles allow full remote from anywhere
   - Could work from lower cost location while earning NYC salary
   - Tax implications: Consult CPA
   - Best for: Single, flexible lifestyle

## Part 6: Tactical Negotiation Playbook

### Salary Negotiation Framework

**When You Have Offer(s):**

1. **Never Accept First Offer**
   - First offer is always negotiable
   - Companies expect 1-2 rounds of negotiation
   - Silence is powerful (wait 24-48 hours)

2. **Use Competing Offers**
   - Get 3+ offers if possible
   - Share numbers between companies
   - "Company X is at $Y total comp, can you match?"
   - Works best: Similar tier companies

3. **Negotiate Total Comp, Not Just Base**
   - Focus on: Base + Equity + Bonus + Sign-On
   - Trade-offs: Higher base vs more equity
   - Ask: "Can you increase the total package to $X?"

4. **Specific Negotiation Scripts**

**Script 1: Initial Response**
```
"Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about the opportunity. I'd like
to take 24-48 hours to review the details and get back to you."
```

**Script 2: Counter Offer**
```
"I'm very interested in joining [Company]. Based on my research and
other conversations I'm having, I was expecting total compensation
in the range of $X-$Y. Is there flexibility to increase the offer?"
```

**Script 3: Leveraging Competing Offer**
```
"I have an offer from [Company X] at $Y total comp. Your company is
my top choice because [specific reasons]. Can you match or exceed
their offer?"
```

**Script 4: Equity Focus**
```
"I understand the base is fixed at this level. Could we increase the
equity grant to bridge the gap? I'm committed to the company's long-term
success and want to be properly aligned."
```

**Script 5: Sign-On Bonus**
```
"I'm leaving $X in unvested equity at my current company. Could we
include a sign-on bonus of $Y to offset this? I could also be flexible
on start date to align with your team's needs."
```

5. **What to Negotiate:**
   - ✅ Base salary (+5-15%)
   - ✅ Equity grant (+10-30%)
   - ✅ Sign-on bonus ($20K-$100K)
   - ✅ Performance bonus percentage
   - ✅ Start date (for current equity vesting)
   - ✅ Title/level (biggest long-term impact)
   - ✅ Remote work flexibility
   - ✅ Relocation assistance
   - ✅ Learning/conference budget
   - ❌ Vacation days (usually fixed)
   - ❌ Health insurance (usually fixed)

### Annual Raise/Promotion Negotiation

**Preparing for Performance Review:**

1. **Document Impact (Keep Brag Doc)**
   - Weekly: Note accomplishments, metrics, wins
   - Quarterly: Summarize major projects
   - Annual: Compile evidence for promotion/raise

2. **Brag Doc Template:**
```
Project: [Name]
Impact: [Revenue, efficiency, users affected]
Your Role: [What you specifically did]
Skills Used: [Technical + PM skills]
Outcome: [Quantified results]
```

3. **Present Business Case**
```
"Based on my contributions this year:
- Led 3 cross-functional projects affecting 2M users
- Reduced incident response time by 40%
- Mentored 2 junior engineers to productivity
- Market rate for my level is $X-$Y
- Requesting: [Specific number] or promotion to [Level]"
```

4. **Timing Matters**
   - Best: After major win/launch
   - Good: Q4 (budget planning season)
   - Okay: After annual review
   - Bad: Random Tuesday with no preparation

## Part 9: Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Career Mistakes That Cost You Money

1. **Staying Too Long**
   - Don't stay 5+ years without big promotions
   - 2-3 years is optimal tenure for comp growth
   - Exception: Equity is vesting and worth staying

2. **Not Interviewing Regularly**
   - Interview at least 2x per year (even if happy)
   - Keeps skills sharp
   - Gives market data
   - Creates optionality

3. **Focusing Only on Base Salary**
   - Total comp is what matters
   - $20K more base but $50K less equity = bad deal
   - Especially at pre-IPO companies

4. **Accepting First Offer**
   - Always negotiate
   - Leave $10K-$50K on table if you don't

5. **Ignoring Taxes**
   - NYC has brutal taxes (city + state + federal)
   - $300K salary ≠ $300K take home
   - Plan for ~35% tax rate

6. **Not Building Brand**
   - Anonymous engineers cap out lower
   - Personal brand = inbound opportunities
   - Start early (takes 18+ months to build)

7. **Lifestyle Inflation**
   - Easy to spend everything in NYC
   - Keep expenses reasonable
   - Save/invest 30-40% of income

8. **Neglecting Network**
   - Most best opportunities come from network
   - Spend 2-5 hours/week networking
   - Help others (referrals, advice)

9. **Wrong Specialization**
   - Don't learn dying tech for higher pay
   - Invest in growing domains (AI, cloud, etc.)
   - Balance: Interest + market demand

10. **Burning Bridges**
    - Tech is small world, NYC tech even smaller
    - Leave jobs gracefully (2 weeks notice)
    - Stay in touch with former colleagues
    - Your ex-coworker could be hiring manager later

## Summary: Your Path to $400K+

### The Formula

**Base Compensation: $200K-$300K**
- Strategic job changes every 2-3 years
- Negotiate aggressively with competing offers
- Target high-paying companies (FAANG, finance, unicorns)
- Push for promotions (Senior → Staff or EM track)

**Side Income: $50K-$150K**
- Freelance consulting: $2K-$10K/month
- Technical writing: $500-$2K/month
- Speaking: $500-$2K/month
- SaaS/passive: $1K-$5K/month (longer-term)

**Total: $250K-$450K within 24 months is achievable**

### Your Advantages

You're starting from a strong position:
- ✅ 5 years SWE experience (prime level for Senior roles)
- ✅ 3 years PM/support (unique differentiator)
- ✅ NYC location (high-paying market)
- ✅ Hybrid skills (bridge technical/business gap)

### The Mindset

1. **You are a business**: Maximize ROI on your time
2. **Negotiate everything**: First offer is never final
3. **Build in public**: Share knowledge, grow brand
4. **Compound advantages**: Each move builds on last
5. **Don't settle**: Market is huge, opportunities abundant
6. **Help others**: Best opportunities come from network

### Final Note

This guide is aggressive but achievable. Not everyone will hit $400K+ in 24 months, but the framework works. The key is consistent execution:

- Interview regularly (even when happy)
- Always be learning (new skills = higher pay)
- Build your brand (compound effect takes time)
- Negotiate hard (90% don't, that's your edge)
- Diversify income (don't rely only on salary)

NYC is one of the best markets in the world for software engineers. With your hybrid PM/Eng background, you have a unique advantage. Use it.

**Start today. Your future self will thank you.**
