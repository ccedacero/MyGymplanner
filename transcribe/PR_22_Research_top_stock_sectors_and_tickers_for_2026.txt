- Wind: Offshore wind developers (selective)
- Rationale: Hyperscaler carbon-free energy mandates

**Natural Gas (20-25%):**
- LNG exporters: Cheniere Energy
- Natural gas E&P: EQT Corporation, Chesapeake Energy
- Pipelines: Kinder Morgan, Williams Companies (MLPs)
- Rationale: Price recovery from $2.19 to $4.00/MMBtu

**Oil (0-10%):** ⚠️ UNDERWEIGHT/AVOID
- If any exposure: Integrated majors with renewable pivot (Chevron, TotalEnergies)
- Avoid: Pure-play E&P facing $66/barrel environment

**Battery Storage (5-10%):**
- Energy storage developers and operators
- Fluence Energy (pure play)
- Rationale: Critical for grid stability with variable renewables

**Investment Strategy:**
- **Position Size:** Market Weight (10-15% of equity portfolio) - SELECTIVE
- **Sub-Sector Critical:** Not a broad energy sector play
- **Nuclear Focus:** Highest conviction for multi-year theme
- **Avoid Oil:** Structural and cyclical headwinds

- **Hedging:** Floating-rate debt (bank loans, CLOs)
- **Hedging:** TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)

**Risk: Fed Policy Error (Probability: 30%)**
- Too tight = recession; too loose = inflation
- **Hedging:** Diversification across rate-sensitive sectors

**Risk: Geopolitical Shock (Probability: 40%)**
- China-Taiwan, Middle East, Ukraine
- **Hedging:** Gold allocation 5-10%
- **Hedging:** Defense contractors
- **Hedging:** Energy for supply disruption potential

### Final Thoughts

2026 presents a stock-picker's market where sector selection and specific theme exposure will drive performance more than broad market beta. The confluence of secular trends (AI, digital transformation, demographic shifts) and cyclical positioning (late-cycle economy, Fed policy, earnings growth) creates both opportunity and risk.

**Highest Conviction Themes:**
1. **AI Infrastructure:** Semiconductors, data centers, enterprise software
2. **Financial Digitalization:** Tokenization, embedded finance, AI banking
3. **Biotech M&A:** Small/mid-cap with novel assets; $1T dry powder
4. **Defense Modernization:** Cyber, space, AI-enabled systems
5. **Nuclear Renaissance:** 24/7 clean power for data centers

**Avoid:**
1. **Traditional Oil & Gas:** Structural decline, $66/barrel target
2. **Office REITs:** Remote work permanently impacting demand
3. **Commodity Chemicals:** Weak industrial demand
4. **Broad Consumer Discretionary:** Wait for clear recovery signals
5. **Utilities (ex-nuclear):** Limited growth, expensive valuations

**The Bottom Line:**
2026 favors growth over value, selectivity over broad exposure, and secular trends over cyclical plays. A concentrated portfolio of 25-35 stocks across the top 5 sectors, rebalanced quarterly, with disciplined risk management should deliver 12-18% returns and outperform the S&P 500's expected 8-12% gain.

**Stay flexible. Stay disciplined. Stay invested in quality.**
